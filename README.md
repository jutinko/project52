# My version of Project 52
A project to do a small project each week. Following the constraints below.

# Why the heck am I doing this?
I always wanted to build something to improve my technical skills in my free
time. But things happen and I always find excuses to not **do** it.

I accidentally came across [kkdai](http://www.evanlin.com/)'s github
[repository](https://github.com/kkdai/project52), and felt heavily inspired.
Just a side note that kkdai was then inspired by another
[guy](https://github.com/jeffersonlam).

# What can the projects be?
The projects should involve the amount of work that can be done by me after
work or over the weekend. The idea behind this is to make myself learn
consistently, so I shall not push myself too hard. Below is the list of
things a project can be:

- A small Golang project. It can be a implementation of an API, an
implementation of a famous algorithm, you name it.
- A blog post about the things I learnt while reading, working, talking to
people or whatever.
- Anything that can make me learn and I can keep and record of. Anything.
